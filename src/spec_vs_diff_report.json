  "summary": "ContactPage.tsx was updated to open a blank window synchronously on submit (before async backend submission) and then navigate it to the generated WhatsApp deep link after a successful submit—aligning with REQ-1’s popup-blocking mitigation. However, due to truncation of ContactPage.tsx, the updated UX messaging and the exact conditional display rules for the popup-blocked warning (REQ-2) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Two non-product/meta files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) were also modified despite not being requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Adjust the blocked-popup UX messaging on the Contact page to clearly instruct the user what to do next in English, and only show the \"browser blocked\" warning when a popup block is actually detected (not for other errors).",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows popupBlocked state handling in the submit handler, but the actual UI rendering and messaging logic is not visible due to truncation, so it cannot be verified that the warning is shown only when popup-blocking is detected, that backend submission failures do not show the popup-blocked warning, and that the final user-facing messaging is updated in English.",
