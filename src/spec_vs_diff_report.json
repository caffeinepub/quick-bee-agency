  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented by introducing a dedicated contact-form WhatsApp number in centralized config and using it to generate a post-submission wa.me link with prefilled submitted fields. REQ-2 cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary because global/header/footer WhatsApp links are not shown as updated or preserved, only described in a summaries file.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Keep the website’s general WhatsApp integration pointing to +919182768591 for standard “Chat on WhatsApp” buttons/links (header/footer/contact info), while still allowing the contact-form-details WhatsApp CTA to target +919181768591.",
      "reason": "The diff shows ContactPage using the dedicated contact-form WhatsApp number, but does not show evidence of updating/preserving the general WhatsApp links in header/footer/other components. The only mention that other links use the general number is in a modified summary document, not in the actual component code changes shown.",

      "description": "Changed/introduced various site configuration fields unrelated to the WhatsApp-number split (e.g., branding text, contact email formatting, contact phone display/tel fields).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to centralize two WhatsApp numbers and adjust which number is used for the contact-form success CTA vs general chat links; it does not request changing site name/tagline/description or altering contact email/phone fields.",
