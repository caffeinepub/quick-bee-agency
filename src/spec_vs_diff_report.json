  "summary": "Most requested frontend updates (centralized WhatsApp/phone config, new service on Services page) appear implemented. Backend contact-form endpoint remains publicly accessible. However, the diff also introduces a new authorization/user-profile subsystem and a migration module that were not requested and may be unnecessary per constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added backend state migration module and enabled migration plumbing in the main actor, despite no explicit upgrade/migration requirement in the BuildRequest.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest allows adding backend/migration.mo only if an upgrade requires state migration; the diff adds backend/migration.mo with a no-op run function and wires it into backend/main.mo without any stated need tied to the requested changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/migration.mo",
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced an authorization/access-control system and user profile APIs (get/save profile, admin-only contact submissions retrieval) that are outside the requested scope.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on contact/WhatsApp info updates, adding a service card, and ensuring contact form works for unauthenticated users; it does not request adding user profile features or role/permission enforcement beyond ensuring submitContactForm remains public.",
